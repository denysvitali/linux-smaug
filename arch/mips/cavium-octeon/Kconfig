	  The CN63XXP1 chip requires build time workarounds to

	  workarounds will cause a slight decrease in performance on
	  non-CN63XXP1 hardware, so it is recommended to select "n"

	help
	  CVMSEG LM is a segment that accesses portions of the dcache
	  as a local memory; the larger CVMSEG is, the smaller the
	  cache is.  The kernel uses two or three blocks (one for TLB
	  exception handlers, one for driver IOBDMA operations, and on
	  models that need it, one for LMTDMA operations). This
	  selects an optional extra number of CVMSEG lines for use by
	  other software.

	  Normally no extra lines are required, and this parameter
	  should be set to zero.
