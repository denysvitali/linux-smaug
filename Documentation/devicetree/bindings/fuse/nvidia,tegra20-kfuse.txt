  - "nvidia,tegra20-kfuse": for Tegra20 and Tegra30
  - "nvidia,tegra114-kfuse": for Tegra114, Tegra124 and Tegra132
  - "nvidia,tegra210-kfuse": for Tegra210
- reg: Should contain a single entry that specifies the physical address and
  length of the KFUSE registers.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in the clock-names property.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
- clock-names: Must include the following entries:
  - "kfuse"
- resets: Must contain an entry for each entry in the reset-names property.
- reset-names: Must include the following entries:
  - "kfuse"

Example:

	kfuse@0,7000fc00 {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra210-kfuse";
		reg = <0x0 0x7000fc00 0x0 0x400>;
		clocks = <&tegra_car TEGRA210_CLK_KFUSE>;
		clock-names = "kfuse";
		resets = <&tegra_car 40>;
		reset-names = "kfuse";
	};
